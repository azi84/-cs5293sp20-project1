STATE STRANGE, PRUITT CONDEMN ATTEMPTS TO SILENCE THOSE
WHO DISAGREE WITH PRESIDENT ENERGY AGENDA
(MONTGOMERY) Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange and Oklahoma Attorney
General Scott Pruitt released the following statement Wednesday:
?Yesterday, Al Gore, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderrnan, and a small handful of
other East Coast State Attorneys General announced what they called an ?unprecedented
coalition? that ?vows to defend climate change progress made under President Obama and to
push the next President for even more aggressive action? by seeking to criminally investigate
energy companies for disputing the science behind global warming.
?We won?t be joining this effort, and we want to explain why. Reasonable minds can disagree
about the science behind global warming, and disagree they do. This scienti?c and political
debate is healthy, and it should be encouraged. It should not be silenced with threats of criminal
prosecution by those who believe that their position is the only correct one and that all dissenting
voices must therefore be intimidated and coerced into silence. It is inappropriate for State
Attorneys General to use the power of their of?ce to attempt to silence core political speech on
one of the major policy debates of our time.
?We are proud to be a part of a different coalition, one driven by respect for the rule of law,
rather than by ambition to use the law to silence voices with which we disagree. Our coalition of
29 states is leading the ?ght to challenge the legality of President Obama?s plan to kill off fossil
fuels his so-called ?Clean Power Plan.? The 29 states and state Attorneys General who are part
of this effort respect our proper role, which is not to pick winners and losers in the energy sector
nor to silence those who disagree with us, but rather to ensure that the EPA is acting consistent
with the power granted to it by Congress and to ful?ll our statutory duties to ensure that the
consumers in our states have access to reliable, affordable energy. In ful?lling these duties, the
29 states and their Attorney Generals understand that all sources of energy should be considered
not just those that we may prefer for one policy reason or another so that we give ourselves
the best possible chance to achieve our goal of energy independence, with reliable and affordable
energy available at the lowest possible cost to our citizens.?

Attorney General Jeff Landry Slams Al Gore?s Coalition
BATON ROUGE, LA Louisiana Attorney General issued the following statement after
yesterday?s press conference by former Vice President Al Gore and those state Attorneys
General supportive of the power plant regulation halted last month by the United States
Supreme Court:
?While I was not surprised to see these Attorneys General announce their intention to continue
working in support of the unlawful and misguided Clean Power Plan ?l was disturbed by their
parallel announcement to ?use all tools at [their] disposal to fight for Climate Progress,? including
the unfettered investigation of individual coal, oil, and natural gas companies? past or current
climate opinions, views, or research. It is one thing to use the legal system to pursue public
policy outcomes; but it is quite another to use prosecutorial weapons to intimidate critics,
silence free speech, or chill the robust exchange of ideas.
We have seen powerful forces at work nationally targeting, most recently and visibly, our
nation?s coal industry. It is now abundantly clear that the crosshairs have shifted to our country?s
oil and natural gas industries.
In contrast to yesterday?s news conference by 16 state Attorneys General from largely non-oil
and gas producing states, Louisiana stands with more than 29 states and state agencies who
remain in steadfast opposition to the Clean Power Plan. I will continue to work my fellow
Attorneys General from across the country to ensure Louisiana workers, job creators, and
consumers are not burdened by the overreach or threatened by this new and disturbing
development of unleashing the prosecutorial arsenal to quell dissent on such an important issue
of public debate.?
